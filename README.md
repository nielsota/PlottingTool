## Setup

### Requirements

* Python (>=3.6)

### Development environment

Create a virtual environment by running:

```shell
python -m venv .venv
```

The virtual environment should be activated every time you start a new shell session before running subsequent commands:

> On Linux/MacOS:
> ```shell
> source .venv/bin/activate
> ```
> On Windows:
> ```shell
> .venv\Scripts\activate.bat
> ```
